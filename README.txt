This is a basic brute force algorithm that is designed to take a word search puzzle and locate all of the words in the puzzle. I have included a couple of samples to show how the word search file should appear if you wish to use it.

I originally wrote the algorithm in Java but converted it to c++ to strength my skills in that particular language, and also because I find executing c++ programs easier when I am using the command line as opposed to Java, which I develop using eclipse.

I have included a make file to make it easier to compile, and when the program is executed, you pass in the name of the text file that comprises of the word search puzzle as a parameter.

Classes have been added to this alogorithm, mainly so that I could continue working with parts of c++ which I struggle with, as well as using pointers. Even though pointers can be tricky, they are quite useful when passing arrays through into functions.
